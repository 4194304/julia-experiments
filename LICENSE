4194304's I hate non-free licensed projects but otherwise you can do whatever license (IHNFLPBOYCDWL)

Here is a bit of terminology here before we get to the main contents of this license:
The loose definition for non-free licenses (that'll be used here) are projects that DO NOT meet any of the following:
1. The Open Source Definition (OSD) (note 1)
2. The GPL definition (note 2)
3. The Free Software Definition (FSD) (note 3)

Feel free to just use all of this without any restrictions (or further restrictions) at all EXCEPT for in projects with non-free licenses. If you plan to use anything in this repository in a non-free project, you have no rights to do so, and essentially all rights are reserved.
