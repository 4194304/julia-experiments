4194304's I hate non-free licensed projects but otherwise you can do whatever license (IHNFLPBOYCDWL)

I have no reason as to why you would want to use this for a project, but there could be some random possible scenario.
Feel free to just use all of this without any restrictions at all EXCEPT for in projects with non-free licenses. If you plan to use anything in this repository in a non-free project, don't even think about it. This license gives you ABSOLUTELY no rights (so all rights are reserved) in that case. 
The only "real" solid definition for non-free licenses (that'll be used here) are projects that DO NOT meet at least one of the following:
1. Meeting the Open Source Definition
2. Being GPL compatible
3. Meeting the requirements of the Free Software Definition

In total I just REALLY hate non-free (and proprietary licenses) in projects, and since I have been in the free software space for a bit, you can probably understand my reasoning behind all of this. I want to license my REALLY random projects under MY terms specifically.
