4194304's I hate non-free licensed projects but otherwise you can do whatever license (IHNFLPBOYCDWL)

Here is a bit of terminology here before we get to the main contents of this license:
The definition (at least in this license) for non-free licenses are projects that DO NOT meet either of the following:
1. The Open Source Definition (OSD) (note 1)
2. The GPL definition (note 2)

Feel free to use anything licensed under this to have no restrictions (or further restrictions) at all, EXCEPT for in projects with non-free licenses by the definition in terminology. If you plan to use anything in this repository in a non-free project by this license's definition, you have no rights to do so, and essentially all rights are reserved.
