4194304's I hate non-free licensed projects but otherwise you can do whatever license (IHNFLPBOYCDWL)

I have no reason as to why you would want to use this for a project, but there could be some random possible scenario.
Feel free to just use all of this without any restrictions at all EXCEPT for in projects with non-free licenses. If you plan to use anything in this repository in a non-free project, don't even think about it. This license gives you ABSOLUTELY no rights (so all rights are reserved) in that case. 
The only "real" solid definition for non-free licenses (that'll be used here) are projects that DO NOT meet at least one of the following:
1. Meeting the Open Source Definition
2. Being GPL compatible
3. Meeting the requirements of the Free Software Definition

If you have a project with a non-free license, please go and figure out the benefits of using an open source license.
From my experience, non-free licenses benefit absolutely nobody involved in any said project. If you don't want people to copy your work due to a fork possibly taking over your project, you should be able to figure out (if your IQ is above that of room temperature) that the chance of that happening is next to none unless you do something controversial. 
In the end though, for the love of god please figure out the realistic chances of something like that happening, and then you'll figure out that you have been irrationally paranoid for all of this time.

If you were just looking here to use one (or more) of my experiments in your FREELY licensed project, ignore lines 8 - 10.
In total I just REALLY hate non-free (and proprietary licenses) in projects, and since I have been in the free software space for a bit, you can probably understand my reasoning behind all of this. I want to license my REALLY random projects under MY terms specifically.
