4194304's I hate non-freely licensed projects but otherwise you can do whatever license (IHNFLPBOYCDWL)

Here is a bit of terminology here before we get to the main contents of this license:
The definition (at least in this license) for free licenses are projects that meet at least one of the following:
1. The Open Source Definition (OSD) (note 1)
2. The GPL definition (note 2)

Feel free to use anything licensed under this in a freely licensed project by this license's definition. If you are going to use anything with this license in a project that does not meet these terms for a free license, this license has effectively all rights reserved to the creator.

This license's terms on freely licensed projects also apply across projects that use work under a different (but allowed by these terms) license. This means that if you use work under this license in for example, a GPL licensed project, the free licensing terms will still apply. Consequently, that means that even in the example GPL project mentioned, other projects still can not use it in projects that do not meet the terms for a free license.

Another case of possible confusion is when a project moves licenses. If a project with this license (or a descendant project with content originally with this license) moves to a license that does not meet the free licensing terms, that would also be in violation of the license's terms.

All of these terms also apply for modified (derivative) works of content both directly or indirectly (through derivatives with an allowed license) under this license, and/or sections of work also related with this license.
